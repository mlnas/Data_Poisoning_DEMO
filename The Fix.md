Step-by-Step Integration Plan
1. Set Up a Parallel Training Pipeline (Shadow Mode)
What it is: Run the robust training process alongside your current system without affecting live operations.

Why it helps: You can monitor performance, spot improvements, and ensure stability before switching anything in production.

How: Use a tool like SecML to train models on filtered data (e.g., using Isolation Forest).

2. Clean & Sanitize Incoming Data
Use tools like:

 Isolation Forest – Flags suspicious, potentially poisoned samples.

 Statistical Filters – Removes data that doesn't match normal patterns.

Deploy these as a preprocessing step in your data pipeline before training or inference.

3. Automate Regular Retraining
Schedule periodic retraining (e.g., weekly or monthly) with:

Poisoning-resistant algorithms.

Outlier-cleaned datasets.

Use CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Airflow, or Jenkins to automate the process with minimal engineering lift.

4. Monitor Model Drift & Performance
Track:

Model accuracy over time.

Volume of flagged (possibly poisoned) inputs.

Differences in predictions between clean and robust models.

Alert if accuracy drops or anomaly rates spike — could indicate a new poisoning attempt.

5. Gradual Rollout to Production
Start with A/B testing:

90% of users hit the current model.

10% hit the robust-trained model.

Gradually increase traffic if the new model proves more secure and accurate.
